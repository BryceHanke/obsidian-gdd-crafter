    "Desire": "The engine of the story. The specific, tangible goal the hero wants (e.g., 'Stop the bomb', 'Get the girl').",
    "Opponent": "The force that wants the same goal as the hero (unity of opposites) and is exceptionally good at attacking the hero's Weakness.",
    "Plan": "The set of guidelines and strategies the hero uses to defeat the opponent. This usually fails or requires adaptation.",
    "Battle": "The final conflict (Climax). It determines who gets the Goal. Must be a physical manifestation of the thematic conflict.",

    "Filter Words": "Distancing words (saw, felt, heard) that place a lens between the reader and the action. Remove them for immersion.",
    "Weak Verbs": "Forms of 'to be' (was, were) that describe state rather than action. Use active verbs instead.",
